## Vector Database

A vector database is a specialized type of database designed to store and search vector embeddings—which are numerical representations of data like text, images, audio, or video. These embeddings are typically generated by machine learning models and are used in tasks like:

- Semantic search (finding similar documents or images)
- Recommendation systems
- Anomaly detection
- Clustering and classification

Instead of traditional keyword-based search, vector databases use similarity metrics (like cosine similarity or Euclidean distance) to find items that are mathematically close to a query vector.

Popular vector databases include:

- Chroma
- Pinecone
- Weaviate
- Milvus
- FAISS (by Facebook, more of a library than a full DB)

#### 1. Cosine Similarity

Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, focusing on their direction rather than magnitude. Its value ranges from -1 (opposite direction) to 1 (identical direction), making it ideal for scenarios where only the orientation matters.

**Example:**  
Suppose you have two sentence embeddings generated by a language model:

- `embedding1 = [0.2, 0.8, 0.5]` (for "AI is fascinating")
- `embedding2 = [0.3, 0.7, 0.6]` (for "Artificial intelligence is interesting")

Cosine similarity will indicate how similar the meanings of these sentences are, regardless of their length or scale.

#### 2. Euclidean Distance

Euclidean distance calculates the straight-line distance between two points in space, considering both direction and magnitude. This metric is best used when the actual size or scale of the vectors is important.

**Example:**  
Suppose you have two image feature vectors:

- `image_vec1 = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]`
- `image_vec2 = [4.0, 6.0, 8.0]`

Euclidean distance will reflect how far apart these images are in the feature space, which is useful for tasks like clustering or anomaly detection.

#### 🔸 Which One to Use?

- Use Cosine Similarity for text embeddings or when vectors are normalized.
- Use Euclidean Distance when absolute position in space is important (e.g., image features, sensor data).

### 🧪 What is ChromaDB?

ChromaDB (often just called Chroma) is an open-source vector database that's particularly popular in the AI and LLM (Large Language Model) ecosystem. It’s designed to be:

- Simple to use with Python
- Integrated with LangChain and other LLM frameworks
- Fast and lightweight, suitable for local or small-scale deployments

ChromaDB is often used to store embeddings from models like OpenAI's or Hugging Face's transformers, and then perform semantic search or context retrieval for chatbots, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and other AI applications.

```py
import chromadb
from chromadb.config import Settings

# Initialize ChromaDB client
client = chromadb.Client(Settings(chroma_db_impl="duckdb+parquet", persist_directory="./chroma_db"))

# Create a collection
collection = client.create_collection(name="my_collection")

# Add documents with embeddings
collection.add(
    documents=["Apple is a fruit", "Python is a programming language", "Mango is delicious"],
    ids=["doc1", "doc2", "doc3"],
    embeddings=[[0.1, 0.2, 0.3], [0.9, 0.8, 0.7], [0.2, 0.1, 0.4]]  # Normally generated by a model
)

# Query for similar documents
results = collection.query(
    query_embeddings=[[0.15, 0.25, 0.35]],  # Example query vector
    n_results=2
)

print(results)

```

### Vector Dimension

In vector databases, "dimension" refers to the number of values (features) in each vector embedding. Each value captures a specific aspect of the data. For example, a vector `[0.1, 0.2, 0.3]` is 3-dimensional, representing three features.

Modern language models often produce embeddings with hundreds or thousands of dimensions (e.g., 768, 1024). Higher dimensions enable more detailed representations but require more computation and storage.

**Example:**

- 3D vector: `[0.1, 0.2, 0.3]`
- 768D vector: `[0.05, 0.12, ..., 0.33]` (768 values)

All vectors in a collection must have the same dimension for similarity search to work properly.
